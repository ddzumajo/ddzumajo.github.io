## About me

My name is Diego and I was born in Madrid in 1988. At the age of 6 my parents gave me a little book of astronomy which sparked my curiosity about the natural world. In 2006 I started my studies in Physics at Universidad Complutense de Madrid. In 2012 I completed the five years degree after spending the last six months at Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México. In 2013 I was really interested in renewables energies and fuels, so I studied a Master of Science about these topics at Universidad Autónoma de Madrid. 

In 2014 I took my first steps as a data analyst in a digital company. After a year in which I learnt about CRM, marketing and google analytics, I decided to came back to the university as a predoctoral researcher. Four years later I defended a thesis with the title __Nanoscale hydrodynamics near solids__.  This period of my life shaped the way I deal with technical problems and helped me to realize that I enjoy the tools, the strategy and the methods to solve the problems even more than the problems themself. This is the reason why in 2019 I finally move to the data science field in the private sector.

Now I am working as a data scientist in an insurtech company based on Madrid.
