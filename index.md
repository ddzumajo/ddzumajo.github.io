# Interests

I enjoy most of my time being outdoors. I practice mountain running and hiking the warmers months, and rock climbing and alpinism in winter. I am an appasionate of mountain races as well as road races. I have finished several marathons and ultra marathons.

At home I spend my time reading books. I enjoy contemporary literature, graphic novel and popular science.

I love writing. For years I wrote articles in several blogs and webs about literature, jazz, science and mountain sports.
